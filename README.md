# churn_customer_prediction
This repository contains an implementation of churn customer prediction using various machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and Confusion Matrix evaluation. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn, which refers to the likelihood that a customer will stop using a service or product.
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to understand customer behavior and make informed decisions to retain customers. Predicting when a customer might leave a service allows businesses to take proactive actions to retain the customer, ultimately leading to better customer satisfaction and business sustainability.

This project focuses on implementing and comparing three popular machine learning algorithms for churn prediction: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Neural Network. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these algorithms using a Confusion Matrix.
Algorithms Used
Random Forest:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.

Decision Tree:
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a feature (or attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

Neural Network:
A neural network is a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that is designed to recognize patterns. It interprets sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, or clustering of raw input.
